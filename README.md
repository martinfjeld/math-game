# Math Game

A simple math game with 3 different difficulties. It also keeps track of your highscore.
This was the very first project I made completely on my own <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/06/coders-high-the-intense-feeling-of-absorption-exclusive-to-programmers.html">(say no more)</a> after
watching some lessons on JS.

It is simple, it works, and I had a lot of fun making it!
